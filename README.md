# Coffeeshop

This support:

- Adding multiple quantity of product by adding-to-cart the item more than 1
  - Design consideration: adding item with quantity is very rare to happen, customer usually only order a single item, therefore it'll be tiring and UI will be cluttered to add input box to accept quantity not to mention the code becoming much more complex than necessary to serve the common need
- Removing item by hovering on cart and click 'x'
- Displaying image of the product
